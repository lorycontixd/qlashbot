----------------------------------------------------------
- "LFG": dont think it's a very good idea.. people spam and it's difficult to keep track (maybe using on_message event with user cooldown to avoid spam)
- "Verified": Can be replaced with called the ^save gametag function and got registered (checks if user already exists to avoid repetitions) (gives points autom. on registration)
- "Champion":  :white_check_mark:  (points awarded manually)
- "Instagram tournament player":  :white_check_mark:  (on_member_update -> role update -> "instagram tournament" string in new role name -> give points automatically)
- "Tournament player": :white_check_mark:  (can be done using tournament counter in player profile in MongoDB. Not sure how to do it for consecutive)
- "Winner": :white_check_mark:  (needs to be checked manually, either with screenshot proof or by moderator checking battlelog) (maybe battle log called using brawlstats API?)
- "Clan member": Same as calling "^save gametag" function in my opinion
- "Qualified": :white_check_mark:  (Can be checked with brawlstats api or just manually)
"Could not have gone better": Good idea but difficult to check, the less screenshots as proof the better because people can easily lie with fake screenshots
